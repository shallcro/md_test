  curatorNotes: |
    While distributor name and place are separate fields, they always appear in tandem. Therefore, a full distributor would be 'Ann Arbor, MI. Inter-university Consortium for Social and Political Research.' 

    Because ICPSR itself is so frequently a distributor, the full name and location of ICPSR is easily accessible via a button in the metadata editor. If a non-ICPSR distributor is necessary, please confirm the standards with the Metadata Librarian. Please note that external distributors are often appropriate for Union Catalog entries.
